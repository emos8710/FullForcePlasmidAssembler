#Pipeline

FullForcePlasmidAssembler uses Trimmomatic and QCAT for tirmming illumina and nanopore data, respectively.
FastQC and Nanoplots are used to quality check the trimmed reads.
Kraken reports are generated from the reads, and then Unicycler is used to perform a hybrid assembly.
Finally, Abcricate with plasmidfinder_db and resfinder_db is run.
